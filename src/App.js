      <p>
        I fail some things in code challenges. It makes me really sad sometimes.
        But lets take those moments, and relive them in an environment where I
        have the time to do them right.{" "}
      </p>

      <h3>Things I've failed at in the past</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Taking long numbers like 7500000.75 and converting it to 7.5M</li>
        <li>Make a viewport responsive css style for a grid</li>
        <li>Thats all i got for now ðŸ’…</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

export default App;
